# Object Detection Algorithm with YOLOv3 and OpenCV

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.13-blue)

This is a revised algorithm that detects objects from both pre-loaded images and live webcam feeds. The algorithm leverages OpenCV and YOLOv3, along with the COCO dataset for training. The quality of the object detection results depends on the quality of the input images and webcam feed.

## Requirements

- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 pre-trained weights
- COCO dataset
- Python 3.x

## Features

- Detect objects from both pre-loaded images and live webcam feeds.
- YOLOv3 and COCO dataset for object recognition.
- Results depend on the quality of the input images and webcam.

## Outputs

The algorithm produces the following outputs:

### Example 1 (Pre-loaded image):
